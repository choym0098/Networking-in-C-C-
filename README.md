# TCP/IP Stack
Implement Layer 2 and 3 of TCP/IP Stack from scratch in C

## Repository Explanation
This repository is for keeping track of footage of me learning about TCP/IP stack (L2 and L3 layers) from a course instructed by Abhishek CSEPracticals and Shiwani Nigam. The course is heavily dependent on student's participation, as, by the nature of the course, students get to write their own code and implement the L2 and L3 layers.
